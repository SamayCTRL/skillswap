## Task Priority Framework

### Priority Levels Explained:
1. **CRITICAL**: Project cannot proceed without these tasks
2. **HIGH**: Core functionality that users expect
3. **MEDIUM**: Value-added features that enhance user experience
4. **LOW**: Nice-to-have features for future iterations

### Daily Task Management:
- **Morning (9-12pm)**: HIGH priority technical tasks (require focus)
- **Afternoon (1-4pm)**: MEDIUM priority development tasks
- **Evening (7-9pm)**: Research and business planning tasks

### Weekly Review Process:
- **Monday**: Plan week priorities, review previous week progress
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check, adjust priorities if needed
- **Friday**: Complete week review, prepare next week planning

## Progress Tracking System

### Completion Tracking:
- [x] = Completed task
- [ ] = Pending task
- [P] = In progress
- [B] = Blocked (waiting on external dependency)
- [S] = Skipped (deprioritized)

### Time Estimation Method:
- **Research tasks**: 2-4 hours each
- **Simple coding tasks**: 1-3 hours each
- **Complex features**: 4-8 hours each
- **Testing phases**: 2-3 hours per feature

### Risk Management:
- **Technical risks**: What if I can't implement a feature?
  - Solution: Research alternative approaches, seek help from online communities
- **Time risks**: What if tasks take longer than expected?
  - Solution: Prioritize core features, move nice-to-have features to future versions
- **Scope risks**: What if I try to build too much?
  - Solution: Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first

## Learning Integration Strategy

### Skill Development Tracking:
- **Week 1-2**: HTML/CSS fundamentals, basic JavaScript
- **Week 3-4**: Advanced JavaScript, responsive design
- **Week 5-6**: Backend development, database management
- **Week 7-8**: Business integration, user experience optimization

### Knowledge Application Method:
1. **Learn**: Research and understand concept
2. **Practice**: Implement simple version
3. **Apply**: Integrate into main project
4. **Refine**: Test and improve implementation

### Documentation Requirements:
- Code comments explaining complex logic
- Decision rationale for business choices
- Learning notes for future reference
- Problem-solving approaches for difficult challenges

---

## Quality Assurance Organization

### Testing Schedule:
- **Daily**: Quick functionality testing after each coding session
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive testing of new features
- **Phase completion**: Full system testing before moving to next phase

### Bug Tracking System:
- **Critical**: Breaks core functionality
- **Major**: Affects user experience significantly
- **Minor**: Small improvements or cosmetic issues

This systematic approach ensures consistent progress while maintaining high quality standards throughout the development process.
