# Screenshots Needed for Criteria B

## For Learning Goal (Strand 1)

### Research Skills - What I Learned
**Screenshot:** Evidence of actual research process
- Take a photo showing one of these options:

**Option A - Research Notes Document:**
- Open a document (Word/Google Docs) with your research notes showing:
  - HTML/CSS learning notes with specific examples (like "div vs header tags")
  - Business model research comparing different platforms (Fiverr charges 20%, Airbnb charges 15%, etc.)
  - Color psychology research notes (blue = trust, green = growth)
  - Sources listed (MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, competitor websites)

**Option B - Side-by-side Comparison:**
- Split your screen to show:
  - Left side: MDN Web Docs or W3Schools page about HTML tags
  - Right side: Your notes document where you wrote down what you learned
  - This shows you actually read and took notes, not just opened tabs

**Option C - Research Summary:**
- Create a simple table/list showing:
  - "What I researched" | "What I learned" | "How it helped my project"
  - Example: "Fiverr business model" | "20% transaction fees" | "Led me to choose subscriptions instead"
  - Include 4-5 research topics with specific findings

### Critical Thinking - How I Made Decisions
**Screenshot:** My decision-making notes
- Take a photo of a document showing:
  - Pros/cons list: "Website Builder vs Coding Everything"
  - Why I chose subscriptions instead of transaction fees
- Make sure the text is readable

## For Product Goal (Strand 2)

### Organization - How I Stayed Organized
**Screenshot:** My project folders
- Take a photo of your file manager showing:
  - "skill-swap" main folder open
  - Subfolders: "public", "css", "js" clearly visible
  - Organized file structure
- All folder names should be easy to read

### Communication - How I Made It User-Friendly
**Screenshot:** My code with explanations
- Take a photo of your code editor showing:
  - HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file open
  - Comments explaining what the code does
  - Clear function/variable names
- Both code and comments need to be readable
